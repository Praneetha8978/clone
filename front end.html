      <p>I taught my final course in Fall 2019. You can view a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uQRrNdpMsU&t=1329s">video of my last lecture</a> video of my last lecture, which was not about computer science.</p>

      <p>Khan Academy now carries  <a href="https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/devin/">algorithms tutorials </a>  for which <a href="https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/devin/">Devin Balkcom</a> and I produced content.</p>

      <p>My newest book is Algorithms Unlocked. The Amazon site for the book is <a href="https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/devin/">here</a>  and the MIT Press site is here.<br>
        I maintain an errata page for Algorithms Unlocked. If you find an error in the book and it's not already in the errata page, send email to algorithms-unlocked@mit.edu. (The email address in the preface of the book is incorrectâ€”the first known error in the book.)<br>
        
        Algorithms Unlocked is the 10,000th book title published by MIT Press.</p>

      <p>Are you looking for solutions to exercises and problems in Introduction to Algorithms?<br>
        If you are, then see the frequently asked question and answer below.<br>
        
        If you request solutions from me, I will not respond.</p>

        <p>I receive many requests from students outside Dartmouth who want to work with me as interns. Sorry, but I do not take interns from outside Dartmouth.</p>

        <p>From July 2004 through June 2008, I was the director of the Dartmouth Institute for Writing and Rhetoric.<br>
          I occasionally taught a graduate Computer Science course on how to write papers and how to give talks. I publish a list of usage rules that I required my students to observe.

        <p><b>Introduction to Algorithms</b></p>
        <p>Yes, I am coauthor of Introduction to Algorithms, along with Charles Leiserson, Ron Rivest, and Cliff Stein. For MIT Press's 50th anniversary, I wrote a post on their blog about the secret to writing a best-selling textbook.<br>
          Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions about Introduction to Algorithms:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Will there be a fourth edition? If so, when will it be available?</dt>
          <dd>The fourth edition is in production. No public release date has been set. If you're wondering whether to hold off buying the third edition in anticipation of the fourth edition, all I can tell you is that the fourth edition will not be available in 2021.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt>Where is the website for the book?</dt>
          <dd>The MIT Press site is <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/content/algorithms.">http://mitpress.mit.edu/content/algorithms.</a> </dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt>Where can I find a list of errata?</dt>
          <dd>We maintain an errata page that allows you to list errors by date, by page, by severity, or by discoverer. There is even an incremental update feature, allowing you to list only the errors posted since the last date that you asked about.<br>
            We stopped logging errors January 2019 so that we could focus on preparing the fourth edition.<br>
            <b>I will not respond to requests for the manual or for solutions.</b>

        <h2>Miscellaneous Personal Stuff</h2>
       <pre> <p>Follow me on
          Twitter: 
          Quora: I'm a "Top Writer" 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. You can listen to the Quoracast (a podcast) in which I was interviewed.
      You can also read about me on Wikipedia. (Note: I did not create this entry, nor have I edited it.) I had been listed among "Noted residents, past and present" in the Wikipedia page on Oceanside, NY, but someone removed me from the Oceanside page with the notation "Removed notable people who barely lived there or people who are not notable." Since I lived in Oceanside for the first 18 years of my life, I can only conclude that I am not notable.
      
      My wife, Nicole, and I took a Barbecue tour of the South in August 1998.
      
      In July 2010, I rollerbladed the Trail of the Coeur D'Alenes, a 71.4-mile-long paved rail trail in the Idaho panhandle. Accompanied by my friend, Paul Daro, who also bladed, and Nicole, who biked, we went 42 miles the first day and the balance the second day. Here is a photo of the three of us at the start of the first day, at the western trailhead in Plummer, Idaho, (on the Coeur D'Alene reservation) and here is a photo of Paul and me at the start of the second day, at the eastern trailhead in Mullan, Idaho. We met this fellow on the trail during the first day. This page has some rough videos that Paul took.
      
      I was the Ice Man for the Maryland State Barbecue Championship in 2003, 2004, and 2005. Here's a photo from the 2005 contest of me with a quad-runner full of 40-pound bags of ice. The photo was taken by the Dizzy Pigs, the 2005 and 2006 Grand Champions. Even with the megaphone, I was pretty hoarse by the end of the second day. The Dizzy Pigs, and all the other contestants, can explain why.
      
      I was Kansas City Barbeque Society Certified Barbeque Judge number 62145. (I have purposely let my KCBS membership lapse.) My first contest as a certified judge was the 2011 Maryland State Championship in Bel Air. Here is a photo of me just starting to judge the first item, chicken. And here is a photo after judging five entries each of chicken, pork ribs, pork, and beef brisket. (Photos courtesy of Craig Ward, a.k.a. "Mr. Time To Go," a.k.a. "Large And In Charge," the contest organizer.)
      
      In September 1997, Nicole and I finished hiking all 48 of the 4000-foot peaks in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.
